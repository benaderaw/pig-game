# pig-game

This app game is not responsive, desktop only.

This is not my original project. While I copied/recreated the game, I did NOT copy the source code, all that I did on my own as a challenge.

Used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (corre-js, parcel), Git

Rules of the game:
1: Roll the dice 
2: If you rolled a 1 it will automatically be the other players turn
3: If you rolled a number greater then 1 you have two choices, keep rolling or click 'HOLD' 
4: If you keep rolling the sum of all the rolled numbers will be shown in the 'current' box (if you roll 1 your current score will go back to 0)
5: If you click 'HOLD' the sum of your rolled number becomes your actual score, it will then be the other players turn
6: Whoever gets to 100 or more points wins the game (you must hit 'HOLD' to win)
